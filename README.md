# Portfolio Projects
###  This repository is an aggregation of all the Data Analysis projects I have done for work, fun, or academic purposes.

> In this project, I performed an analysis on COVID-19 data from Nigeria. I used Microsoft excel and SQL
> for the data wrangling, also used SQL to perform the data exploratory analysis in order to draw key insights, and used Tableau for visualization.

> In this project, I performed exploratory analysis on two datasets; The FBI NICS Firearm Background Check Dataset, and the US census dataset. I used Microsoft Excel to correct some errors in the dataset such as converting one of the datasets from the .xlsx format to .csv, but majority of the entire analysis process was carried in Jupyter Notebooks with the Numpy, Pandas and Matplotlib python libraries.
