> In this project, I performed an analysis on COVID-19 data from Nigeria. I used Microsoft excel and SQL
> for the data wrangling, used SQL to perform exploratory analysis in order to draw key insights, and Tableau for visualization.

> In this project, I performed exploratory analysis on two datasets; The FBI NICS Firearm Background Check Dataset, and the US census dataset. I used Microsoft Excel to correct some errors in the dataset such as coverting one of the datasets from the .xlsx format to .csv, but majority of the entire analysis process was carried in Jupyter Notebooks with the Numpy, Pandas and Matplotlib python libraries.
